Arrays is a set of continuous memory location capable of holding homogenous type of data (data of same
type) whose base address is held by the array name. The other elements of the array are accessed by
using the [] operator inside which we pass in the index, and JVM then finds the offset of that index from
the base address and accesses the element that we need.

The limitation of arrays happen when we have to delete an element. To achieve it, we need to shift all
the elements to the right of the deleted element one by one, which adds another layer of complexity to
the problem.
